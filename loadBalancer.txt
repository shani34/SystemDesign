# Load Balancing
It is basically a way of distributing the load across dofferent servers.
And consistence Hashing is way of implementing the load across all servers evenly and at same time keeping scalability of servers in mind.

Old way of consistence hanshing does not work when it comes to adding a new server which takes a lot of changes
we can take some load from each of the server up to new load distribution.

Drawback in first one:
    it way taking too much change while adding 

Solution:    
    1. New way of consistence Hashing is to hash the request ID in the form of ring(0,1,4,....m-1).
    2. and also hash the server by using same hash function and take the modulo by m
    3. now the request will be served by the nearest server
    4. why are choosing in this way because hashing is uniform random that is why load will be uniform random.
    5. load factor will be 1/N.
In the above solution we had issue when one of the server goes down then nearest server overloads.
    6. to avoid this we can make k hash function and do the hashing of server and divide the server more evenly.
