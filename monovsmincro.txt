advantage of monolith
1. all monolith architecture rest on single service
2.its faster because we do local call instead of interservice call
2.too much coupling
4. whole code base in single service


advantage of micorservice
1. easy to maintance
2. parallel working on different service
3. not easy to design 
4. easy to scale
5. easy to extended 

#for larger system/team micorservices are best solution


for moving from mono to micro 
its better to implement new features in new services 
instead of directly moving directly from mono to micro
