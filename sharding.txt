#Database Sharding

1. It is way of divinding the database based on different unique id(horizontal partitioning of database).
3. fixed number of shards(we can avoid by using heirarchical sharding(meaning shards of shard)).
4. memcache uses consistence hashing for sharding.
5. we can have indexing on shards.
6. each shard is basically different database server running.

Problem is JOINS from across the shards.
